# InkyThreatLevel
UK Threat Level Monitor using Raspberry Pi Zero W and Pimoronis InkyPhat Red


Good morning fellow pirates.  Considering the fact that a certain Russian despot has just been given another 6 years in power after a   ̶*̶t̶o̶t̶a̶l̶l̶y̶ ̶f̶a̶i̶r̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶d̶e̶m̶o̶c̶r̶a̶t̶i̶c̶*  election, and his penchant for threatening the world with nuclear war, I thought it prudent to create a little project to let me know if shit is about to hit the fan.  Mostly so I can sit down and cry as I live within vaporising distance of one of his reported missile targets.

This project uses a:
Pi Zero W with pre soldered headers - https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w
InkyPhat Red - https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-phat

This was a fun, and sometimes frustrating, little project for me.  I hope someone else finds it useful!
